HEX F300 M acoustic guitar that has had only light use. Well looked after and in excellent condition with the exception of minor cosmetic damage on the back bottom edge, which is only noticable from the rear and does not affect guitar in any way.

Despite being a relatively low cost guitar it produces are very well balanced and rich sound, with the new strings adding an extra brightness. The guitar is barely used and kept away from direct sunlight and humidity.

Includes HEX gig bag, which can be used like a backpack, and a foldable stand I bought used. The strings have recently been replaced with high quality and long life Exixir Nanoweb 11/52. The slightly lighter gauge of the strings is easier on the fingers for less frequent players and the strings are known to last a very long time.

Sad to be selling as it's more than just an instrument to me, but I barely use it and feel it would be better off in the hands of someone who will get more use out of it. Would sell for 130,000₩ but discounted by 30,000₩ to account for the cosmetic damage.

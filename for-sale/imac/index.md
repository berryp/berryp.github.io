#### Details

The iMac has upgraded storage from the old and slower Fusion Drive to a fast SSD and tripple the amount of base memory. It has been well looked after and with the exception of the minor cosmetic damage mentioned below is in excellent condition. The system has been factory reset and the software is fully up to date.

The cosmetic damage is a hairline crack in the bottom left corner of the screen glass that is limited to the black border. This is barely noticable and does not extend beyond the black border into the viewiable screen area. There is no technical damange and everything else is in full working order.

The computer is an excellent workhorse with an amazing screen - even today it's still considered one of the best screens in the market. It is very capable and has been used for software development, music production and even gaming. Selling as I moved to using a Mac Mini.

Includes purpose built solid travel case (suitable for checked-baggage) that can be used like standard wheeled luggage. It's the same design and material used for instrument cases. This is included for free.

HEX F300 M acoustic guitar that has had only light use. Well looked after and in excellent condition with the exception of minor cosmetic damage on the back bottom edge.

Despite being a relatively low cost guitar it produces are very well balanced and full sound, with the new strings adding an extra brightness. The guitar is barely used and kept away from direct sunlight and humidity.

Includes official HEX soft carry case which can be used like a backpack. The strings have recently been replaced with high quality and long life Exixir Nanoweb 11/52. The slightly lighter gauge of the strings is easier on the fingers and therefore great for non-seasoned players.

Sad to be selling as it's more than just an instrument to me, but I barely use it and feel it would be better off in the hands of someone who will get more use out of it.
